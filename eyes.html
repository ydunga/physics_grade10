            </div>
            <p>In grade 8 you learnt about the human eye and its structure. You know that we have a convex lens in our eye and that an inverted image of the objects we see is formed on the <b>retina</b>.</p>
            <p>In this section you will learn more about the human eye and our vision.</p>

            <p>Below you can see the structure of the human eye. </p>
            <object data = "svgs/eyedetails.svg" type = "image/svg+xml" width = 80% height = "600" ></object>
            <p>Light enters our eyes through the cornea. </p>
            <p>Most of the refraction of light happens at the outer surface of the cornea. The lens allows for adjustment of the focal length to focus on objects at different distances!</p>
            <p>The retina- on which the image of everything we see is formed have light sensitive cells. </p>
            <p>These cells then generate electrical signals, which are sent to the brain via optic nerves.  </p>

            </div>
            <p>The ability of the human eye to see objects at different lengths with clarity is nothing short of amazing. </p>
            <p>With the knowledge you have of focal lengths and lenses, you should know by now that in order to form clear images of objects at different distances, the focal length of the lens in the eye has to change. </p>
            <p>The ability of the eye to adjust its focal length via ciliary muscles is known as <b>accomodation</b>.</p>
            <p>However, even the human eye has its limitations. </p>
            <p>If you were to hold an object extremely close to your eye, you will still be able to see an object but it will be blurry or out of focus. </p>
            <p>There is a minimum distance at which you must view an object from, to be able to see it clearly. For the human eye this minimum distance is 25cm. </p>

                <div class = "subback">Vision defects</div>
            </div>
            <p>Many people suffer from common vision defects where the eye looses its power of accomodation. </p>
            <p>As a result of this, objects that are too close or too far off might not be clearly visible. </p>
            <p>These vision defects can be fixed with the use of corrective lenses. </p>

                <div class = "subback">Myopia - near sightedness</div>
            </div>
            <p>A person is said to suffer from myopia when they can see nearby objects clearly, but far off objects are not visible clearly. </p>
            <p>This is caused because, instead of the image forming on the eye's retina, it is formed in front of the retina. </p>
            <object data = "svgs/myopia.svg" type = "image/svg+xml" width = 80% height = "500"></object>
        <p>Since the light rays are converging too soon in the case of myopia, what we need is a lense which will suitable diverge the light rays before the enter the eye, such that the convergence of rays now happens at the retina.</p>

                <div class = "subback">Hypermetropia - far sightedness</div>
            </div>
            <p>In case of hypermetropia, a person can see far off objects clearly , but nearby objects are not visible clearly. </p>
            <p>This happens becuase the light rays are converging behind the retina. </p>
            <object data = "svgs/hypermetropia.svg" type = "image/svg+xml" width = 80% height = "500"></object>
            <p>To fix this defect we need to use a convex lens(convergence) that will make the image converge at the retina. </p>
